# Autostrada: A Go-lang Scaffold Generator (Quick Review)

If you are new, you will find that there aren't any "tested and trusted" folder structures that just work. Each application is different and comes with its own challenges.  Autostrada claims to help with this decision by choosing for you.

In this video, I go over what I like and don't like about Autostrada. I also suggested a simpler alternative which involves using the built-in go-lang template generator. 

A few notes:

After watching this video, I realize there are a couple of other tools out there that claim to do the same thing. Some of them are:

- [Zero](https://github.com/commitdev/zero)
- [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) | Although suited for the JavaScript community, it can be used for Go-lang as well.

I will be reviewing these tools in the future.
